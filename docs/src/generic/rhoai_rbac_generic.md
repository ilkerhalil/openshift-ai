## General Explanation
OpenShift AI relies on most of the underlying mechanisms in OpenShift for controlling access to OpenShift AI. In vanilla OpenShift, you create projects which then have various security methods applied to them in order to ensure that administrators have fine-grained control over who can access which objects and with what permissions. A Data Science Project is just an OpenShift Project that has a specific label which enables it to be used with the OpenShift AI Dashboard.
