In contrast to the OpenShift AI Operator, the Pipeline Operator only requires an appropriate subscription to become active on the cluster. 

Navigate to **Operators --> OperatorHub** on the left hand menu in the OpenShift UI and search for OpenShift Pipelines and select the appropriate option:

![pipelineoperator1](../images/ai_pipelines_operator1.png)

The next screen is informational with no options to select. Click **Install**:

![pipelineoperator2](../images/ai_pipelines_operator2.png)

The defaults on the Operator page can be used safely. If you know you need a specific version of the Pipeline Operator, select the appropriate Update Channel and then click install and wait for the operator installation to complete.
